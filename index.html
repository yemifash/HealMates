            <p><strong>  Three-quarters of all suicides are men, with suicide being the leading cause of death for men under 50 in many countries, including the UK.</strong></p>
            <p>Despite these alarming figures, many men continue to suffer in silence, believing that seeking help is a sign of weakness.</p>
            <p>At HealMates, we aim to change this narrative by offering a safe space for men to talk openly about their struggles and find the support they need to reclaim their mental wellbeing.</p>
